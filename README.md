# hammerspoon-config
Personnal hammerspoon config, includes app launching, moving and resizing windows.

### Note

I've changed the location of my hammerspoon config to `~/.config/hammerspoon`. This path is used inside my configs, so some things might break if you don't take that into account.

To change the location of the hammerspoon config:

```
defaults write org.hammerspoon.Hammerspoon MJConfigFile "~/.config/hammerspoon/init.lua"
```
